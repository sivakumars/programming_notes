## Exercise 1

Input: text file
Output:
- sentence (longest in paragraph)
- number (number of words in sentence)
Rules:
- any sequence of chars that isn't space or . ! ? is a word.

Steps:
- Open file from disk
- Read file into a string
- Split string on spaces
- Loop through array of words
	- Add each word to a new array
	- If the word ends in a . ? ! then create a new array after adding that word
- Loop through array of setences
	- count number of words in sentence
	- store sentence in variable
	- compare to next sentence
	- store sentence with higher count
- Return sentence and sentence count

Steps:
- Read file into string
- Walk through string and if you hit a . ? !, push everything upto that punctuation mark into an array
- Keep doing that until you run out of characters

# Exercise 2

Input: string
Output: true/false
Rules: 
- the string can only contain one letter from each block
- case doesn't matter

Manual Steps:

- loop through each character
	- if the character exists in the collection
		- remove character and it's pair (i.e. the block) from the collection
	- else if the charater doesn't exist
		- return false
- if the entire loop finishes, return true

Try using an array of arrays. Check if array matches. Remove inner array if it does. 

Steps:
