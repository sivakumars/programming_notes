## Question 1

# def meal
#   return 'Breakfast'
# end
#
# puts meal

# It will print "Breakfast".

## Question 2

# It will print "Evening."

## Question 3

# It will print "Breakfast"

## Question 4

# It will print both "Dinner" and "Breakfast"

## Question 5

# It will print "Dinner" because the method invokes the method puts. And
# then it will print "nil" because the last line of the method returns
# nil, and the 'p' method prints the return value of its argument.

## Question 6

# It will only print "Breakfast" because the return on the 1st line exits
# the method and the final 2 lines are never run. Also, 'nil' is returned.

## Question 7

# 0 1 2 3 4 nil. Actually it ends in 5. The times block returns 5, and
# when a method contains a block, the entire block counts as the last
# line in the method. So 5 is returned by the method and printed
# by the puts.

## Question 8

# 0 1 2 3 4 10

## Question 9

# 0 1 2 nil

## Question 10

# 1
