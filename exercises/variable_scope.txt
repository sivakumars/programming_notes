6) 'my_value': undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object (NameError)'

7) 3

8) Error because 'a' was never defined.

a = 7

iteration 1: set a = 1, then a = a + 1 = 2
iteration 2: set a = 2, then a = a + 1 = 3
iteration 3: set a = 3, then a = a + 1 = 4

WRONG. Since the block uses the same variable name as an outside variable, it
hides the local variable (i.e. shadowing).

10) Error because 'a' is visible inside the method.
