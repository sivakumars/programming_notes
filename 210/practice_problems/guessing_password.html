Input: user enters password 3 times
Output: message after each password attempt
Rules:
- if user is wrong 3 times, end program and write denied message
Steps:
- Set gusses to 0
- Loop while guesses is less than 3
  - Ask user to enter password
  - check if password is correct
  - if correct, display correct message
  - if wrong, increment guesses by 1, and ask again
- if guesses >= 3, deny
