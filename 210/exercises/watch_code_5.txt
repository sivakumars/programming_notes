PROBLEM:

Implement encoding and decoding for the rail fence cipher.

The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded. It was already used by the ancient Greeks.

In the Rail Fence cipher, the message is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom (like a zig-zag). Finally the message is then read off in rows.

Algorithm:
- Initialize a result array that has n (number rails) nested arrays
- Replace all spaces in text with empty strings
- Split the string into an array of chars
- Assign characters to nested arrays in zig-zag fashion
  - Set count = 0;
  - Set reversed = false;
  - While (count < compactedString.length)
    - Set nestedIndex = 1;
    - Push char to (nestedIndex - 1) array
    - count++
    - If nestedIndex === 1,
      - reversed = false;
      - nestedIndex++
    - Else If nestedIndex === n:
      - nestedIndex--
      - reversed = true
    - Else if reversed === true
      - nestedIndex--
    - Else, nestedIndex++
- Concat all arrays together
- Join resulting array on ''
- Return string
