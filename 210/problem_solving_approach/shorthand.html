Problem Statement: You are given a list of numbers in a "short hand" range notation where only the significant part of the next number is written because we know the numbers are always increasing (e.g. "1, 3, 7, 2, 4 1" represents [1, 3, 7, 12, 14, 21]). Some people use different separators for their ranges (ex. "1 3, 1 2", "1:3, 1:2", "1..3, 1..2" represent the same numbers as [1, 2, 3, 11, 12]) Range limits are always inclusive.

Your job is to return a list of the complete numbers.

The possible separators are: ["-", ":", ".."].

Input: string of digits, commas, and separators
Output: array of numbers
Rules:
-

Examples:
Data Structure:
Algorithm:








Input: string of ranges
Output: array
Rules:
- The input string is comma-separated by ranges of 10. When you split the string on commas, the first range represents a subrange of digits between 1-9, the second range --> 10-19, and so on.
- Each subrange is always increasing and the subrange is inclusive between the numbers listed for that range
- Each range could be separated by -, :, or .., or space

Data Structure:
- To iterate on each range, it makes sense to use an array for the input string
- And then another array for splitting each range into the ends of the subrange
- And obviously need to output an array

Algorithm:
- Initialize a results array
- Initialize a range_factor to 0
- Split the input string on commas to obtain an array of subranges
- Iterate on the array of subranges
  - Split each subrange by one of the 4 separators
  - Iterate from the first element of the subrange to the last element
    - Push (index values + range factor) into the results array
  - Increment range factor by 10 for each subrange
- Return results array

Mistakes:
- Not fluent with RegEx
- Forgot to convert array of strings to array of numbers to iterate on their values
