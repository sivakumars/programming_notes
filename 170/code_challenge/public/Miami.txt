Walking along South Beach (the main street and the coastline) was very interesting. It is such an eclectic mix of people and personalities. There were Americans from all over the country, Europeans from all over Europe, and conveniently it was the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. I did not know this on my first night and I thought to myself: “I have never seen this many masculine looking females in one place in my life.” On the beach, you see many women in thongs and many men in speedos. I overheard some Americans remark “Look at that girl, she’s wearing a thong!” These sights are so shocking to us Americans yet are commonplace to Europeans.  You see a hot woman walking hand in hand with a good looking guy in a speedo. Most Americans would see this guy and think to themselves: "definitely gay”. In Europe, perhaps it is normal. When a “wholesome” American girl sees a European girl in a thong, she makes a hasty remark which is quite clearly in disgust. These thoughts that we have towards people who do things differently than us are so overly judgmental. If those same Americans grew up in Europe, they would be wearing speedos and thongs too. I guess I just came to realize how ridiculous it is that people judge other people based on their outward appearance. Forget skin color or the amount of tattoos, but simply their fashion. Why do we place so much value (positive or negative) in the type of shoes someone is wearing or how tight someone’s dress is? It seems like all we are doing is boosting our own ego by putting someone else down. The worst part is that the emotion feels innate. I hear it in my own head and it is difficult to stop. There are definitely evolutionary reasons behind being familial and hostile towards people or groups that are different than us. It just seems like the reason for that emotion in our brain is not useful in today’s society. I wish we could just turn it off. It does not seem to help accomplish any kind of noble purpose.
