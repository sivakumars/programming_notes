Introduction
------------

Human beings use their brains to remember things that happened in the past and make decisions for the future. But because their brains have limited capacity, humans record information on paper or a computer. This information is called **data**. When the amount of data grows large, it's often stored in a **database** so that a computer can be used to more quickly a retrieve and analyze it.

Most data, for example, the content of a text message, is *unstructured*. A text message comes with additional *structured* data though. While the content of each text can vary wildly, each text has a sender's phone number, a receiver's phone number, and a date and time that the text was sent.

A **relational database** is a database that stores structured data in *tables* of columns and rows. Tables are also called relations or entities. Rows are also called records or tuples. Columns are also called attributes or fields.

| phone_number | name    |
|--------------|---------|
| 123-456-7890 | "Bob"   |
| 987-654-3210 | "Nitin" |
| 612-612-6120 | "Carlos"|

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is an application that enables interaction between a user and a database. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and IBM DB2. The term "database" is often used interchangeably with an RDBMS, and **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the *special purpose language* used to interact with the RDBMS.

A database's structure is described in what's called a **schema**. In addition to specifying column names, the schema indicates what kind of data is allowed in a particular column. For example, the `name` column should only allow text. This restriction is called a column's **data type**. Another SQL feature called a **constraint** makes it possible to further restrict possible values of a column, for example, ensuring that all values in the `phone_number` column are unique or that all values in the `name` column are longer than 1. Lastly, while the schema describes the structure of the database, the **data** is the actual content that exists within that structure, like "Bob" and "Nitin" in the example above.

SQL
---

SQL is really three languages in one, containing smaller sub-languages for data definition, data manipulation, and data control. The **data definition** sub-language allows a user to create and modify the database schema (e.g. CREATE, DROP, ALTER). The **data manipulation** sub-language allows a user to retrieve and modify data stored in a database (e.g. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). The **data control** sub-language allows a user to control the rights and access roles of the users that interact with a database or table (e.g. GRANT).

Primary Keys
--------------

A **key** uniquely identifies a single row in a database table. A **natural key** is an attribute of the data that can be used to uniquely identify a row of data, for example, the `phone_number` column in the Contacts table. Since a natural key can often change, however, it's preferred to use a **surrogate key**, a key created solely for the purpose of identifying a row of data in a table.

A surrogate key is commonly configured as an *auto-incrementing integer* that increases by 1 for each new row. PostgreSQL contains a keyword, `serial`, that automatically configures a surrogate key column when creating a table. The two SQL statements below are equivalent.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id serial
);

CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('table_name_id_seq')
);
```

As part of the `serial` configuration, a special table that stores a series of numbers is created called a **sequence**. This sequence is passed as an argument to the `nextval` function which is assigned as the `DEFAULT` value of the column. This ensures that the default value of the `id` column for every added row will be 1 greater than the value of the previous row.

The last step is to ensure that all values of the `id` column are unique and NOT NULL by adding a couple constraints to the column.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id serial UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY
);
```

A **primary key** is a column that uniquely identifies a row in a table. While any number of columns can contain UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraint, a table is only allowed one primary key. To assign these two constraints and indicate the column is the primary key of the table, PostgreSQL provides a `PRIMARY KEY` keyword. It's an accepted convention in Web Development to create a **primary key** column named `id` in all database tables.

Index
-----

An **index** is a mechanism to speed up data retrieval by storing commonly accessed columns in a separate and ordered table-like structure. Each time a new row is inserted into an indexed column, the index is updated. So while indexes increase the speed of data retrieval, they can decrease the speed of data inserts and updates. And therefore indexes are best used in tables where reads are more common.

Database Relationships
-----------------------

Databases aim to reduce duplication by splitting a table into multiple tables. **Normalization** is the process of designing schema to eliminate data duplication and minimize the occurrence of update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. When related data is split (as shown below) into multiple tables, their relationships are preserved using  **foreign keys**.

#### Denormalised Table of Text Messages

| id | sender_phone | sender_name | receiver_phone | receiver_name | content      |
|----|--------------|-------------|:--------------:|---------------|--------------|
| 1  | 123-456-7890 | "Bob"       |  987-654-3210  | "Nitin"       | "Hello"      |
| 2  | 987-654-3210 | "Nitin"     |  123-456-7890  | "Bob"         | "Hey"        |
| 3  | 987-654-3210 | "Nitin"     |  123-456-7890  | "Bob"         | "What's Up?" |

#### Texts

| id | sender_id | receiver_id| content        |
|----|-----------|:----------:|----------------|
| 1  | 1         |  2         | "Hello"        |
| 2  | 2         |  1         | "Hey"          |
| 3  | 2         |  1         | "What's up?"   |
| 4  |           |  2         | "Who is this?" |

#### Contacts

| id | phone_number | name    |
|----|--------------|---------|
| 1  | 123-456-7890 | "Bob"   |
| 2  | 987-654-3210 | "Nitin" |
| 3  | 612-612-6120 | "Carlos"|

A **foreign key** is a column that uses another table's primary key value to point to a specific row in that table. In this manner, it creates a relationship between two rows belonging to two different tables. The Texts table has a `sender_id` column that contains values that point to a corresponding row in the Contacts table. Specifically, it points to values in the `phone_number` column, the Contacts table's primary key column. The similar relationship exists with the `receiver_id` column, indicating that there are two foreign keys in the Texts table.

A **foreign key constraint** enforces certain rules about what values are permitted in a foreign key column. There are two ways to create this constraint.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_id integer REFERENCES contacts(id)
  name varchar(255)
);

ALTER TABLE table_NAME ADD CONSTRAINT table_name_contact_fkey FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id);
```

A foreign key constraint ensures that all values in a foreign key column also exist in the primary key column of the referenced table.

There are three types of table relationships with three different implementations in relational databases:

- One-to-One --> PRIMARY KEY of 1st table is used as both FOREIGN KEY and PRIMARY KEY of 2nd table
- One-to-Many --> PRIMARY KEY of 1st table is used as FOREIGN KEY of 2nd table
- Many-to-Many --> 3rd cross-reference table (i.e. *join table*) uses a composite PRIMARY KEY — containing the PRIMARY KEYs of the two other tables — to store the relationship between those tables.

**Cardinality** is the number of objects on each side of the relationship. The cardinality can be  "one" or "many". The **modality** of a relationship indicates if the relationship is required (1) or optional (0). Cardinality and Modality are useful for defining the *business rules* that control an application.

SELECT Query Execution Steps
----------------------

1) Rows are collected into a virtual table
2) Rows are filtered using `WHERE` conditions. Any rows that don't satisfy the conditions are removed.
3) Rows are divided into appropriate groups based on `GROUP BY` columns.
4) Groups (of rows) are filtered using `HAVING` conditions.
5) Elements in the `SELECT` list are evaluated, including functions, and the results are labeled with the column name or function name unless otherwise specified by an `AS` clause.
6) The results are sorted as indicated by an `ORDER BY` clause.
7) The actual rows returned are determined using `LIMIT` or `OFFSET` clauses.

JOIN
-----

A **JOIN** is a SQL clause that returns rows from two different tables based on a common column between them. There are several slightly different types of JOINs.

An **INNER JOIN** returns the rows for which the common column had a matching value. For each row in the first table, if there is a row in the second table that matches the join condition for that row, then a new row combining values from both tables is created in a virtual table created by the JOIN.

`SELECT * FROM texts JOIN contacts ON sender_phone = phone_number;`

| id | sender_phone | receiver_phone | content        | name    | phone_number |
|----|--------------|:--------------:|----------------|---------|--------------|
| 1  | 123-456-7890 |  987-654-3210  | "Hello"        | "Bob"   | 123-456-7890 |
| 2  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "Hey"          | "Nitin" | 987-654-3210 |
| 3  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "What's up?"   | "Nitin" | 987-654-3210 |

Note that the JOIN table only contains the 3 rows that matched.

A **LEFT OUTER JOIN** includes the results of an INNER JOIN plus the rows from the first table that didn't meet the join condition, placing NULL values in the second table's columns.

`SELECT * FROM contacts LEFT JOIN texts ON phone_number = sender_phone;`

| id | sender_phone | receiver_phone | content        | name    | phone_number |
|----|--------------|:--------------:|----------------|---------|--------------|
| 1  | 123-456-7890 |  987-654-3210  | "Hello"        | "Bob"   | 123-456-7890 |
| 2  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "Hey"          | "Nitin" | 123-456-7890 |
| 3  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "What's up?"   | "Nitin" | 123-456-7890 |
| 3  | 987-654-3210 |  111-111-1111  | "Who is this?" |         | 111-111-1111 |

Note that the JOIN table contains 4 rows even though there was no matching `name` found for 111-111-1111.

A **LEFT OUTER JOIN** includes the results of an INNER JOIN plus the rows from the second table that didn't meet the join condition, placing NULL values in the first table's columns.

| id | sender_phone | receiver_phone | content        | name    | phone_number |
|----|--------------|:--------------:|----------------|---------|--------------|
| 1  | 123-456-7890 |  987-654-3210  | "Hello"        | "Bob"   | 123-456-7890 |
| 2  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "Hey"          | "Nitin" | 987-654-3210 |
| 3  | 987-654-3210 |  123-456-7890  | "What's up?"   | "Nitin" | 987-654-3210 |
|    |              |                |                | "Carlos"| 612-612-6120 |

Note that the JOIN table again contains 4 rows even though there were no texts sent by "Carlos".

A **FULL OUTER JOIN** includes the results of an INNER JOIN plus the rows from both the first and second table that didn't meet the join condition, placing NULL values appropriately in the non-matching rows.

Subquery
----------

A subquery is a SQL query nested inside a larger SQL query. Along with a JOIN, it's most often used as a way to return data from multiple tables. There are 3 different types of subqueries based on what the nested query returns.

**Scalar Subquery:** The nested query can return a single value (e.g. aggregation) that can then be used with a WHERE clause.

**Subquery as a Virtual Table:** The nested query can return a column of values that can be used with an IN clause. And the nested query can return a virtual table that can be used in a FROM clause.

**Column Subquery:** In SQL, there is often more than one way to return a set of results. For example, most JOIN queries can instead be written as a subquery, although JOINs are preferred because they're generally faster than subqueries.

Aggregation
------------

An aggregation is a calculation that turns a column of values into a single value. Aggregations are often used together with a GROUP BY statement to turn subsets of a column into several single values. For example, instead of returning the number of text messages in a table, you can return the number of text messages that have the same `sender_phone`.

Sequel
------

Sequel is a database interface library / toolkit / API that allows SQL queries to be represented as Ruby objects.

A Sequel::Database object represents a virtual connection to a database. A Sequel::Dataset object represents a SQL query, or more generally, an abstract set of rows in the database.

```ruby
require "sequel"

DB = Sequel.connect('postgres://localhost/db_name') # creates Sequel::Database object

results = DB[:table_name] # creates Sequel::Dataset object with "SELECT * FROM table_name"
```

A Dataset instance does not always immediately run its query. It will wait until the results of the query are needed. For example, while an `UPDATE` or `INSERT` query will run immediately, a `SELECT` queries isn't run until the results of the query are requested using an instance method like `all`, `first`, or `count`.

As mentioned, a Dataset represents an abstract set of rows and each row is represented as a hash. Therefore, `results.all` will return an array of hashes and `results.first` will return a hash representing the first row of results. In addition, Dataset implements Ruby's Enumerable module, so Ruby methods like `each` and `map` will all work as expected.

SQL Queries in Sequel
---------------------

`CREATE TABLE table_name (col_name col_type options,...);`

```ruby
create_table(:table_name) do
  primary_key :id
  String :name, unique: true
  Integer :age, null: false, default: 0
  Numeric :cost, size: [4,2]
  Float :height
  Boolean :adult
  check{char_length(name) > 2}
end
```

`INSERT INTO table_name (col_name,...) VALUES (col_value,...);`

```ruby
DB[:table_name].insert(name: "Nitin", age: 30, height: 76.0, adult: true)
```

`SELECT col_names FROM table_name WHERE col_name = col_value ORDER BY col_name DESC;`

```ruby
