201 Study Guide
=================

Notes created while preparing for Assessment 209. This assessment is designed to test knowledge of course 201 and will focus on HTML and CSS.

Introduction
------------

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that describes the content of a web page. **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation and appearance of an HTML web page. HTML and CSS documents are simply plain-text documents saved with a corresponding `.html` or `.css` extension. HTML and CSS are designed to enable the separation of content from the appearance of the content. This separation improves accessibility, performance, ease of maintenance, and can reduce redundancy by allowing the same CSS stylesheets to be applied to many web pages. Any visible content should be included in the `<body>` element.

HTML
-----

To inform a web browser that you are using the latest version of HTML, `<!DOCTYPE html>` should be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document. Inside an `<html>` element, a `<head>` element should contain information about the document (e.g. document character set, document title, links to external stylesheets or files). Any content inside the `<head>` is not displayed on the web page itself.

HTML **elements** are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a web page. Most elements are marked by a pair of opening and closing **tags**, and the content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. **Attributes** are properties defined within the opening tag and provide additional information about an element. Each attribute contains a *name* and a *value*.

Not all elements consist of opening and closing tags. There are a number of self-closing elements, here are a few: `<br>`, `<img>`, `<meta>`, `<embed>`, `<input>`, `<link>`.

HTML Elements
--------------

There are generally text-level elements and structural elements.

Text-level elements include block-level heading elements (e.g. `<h1>` - `<h6>`), block-level paragraph elements (`<p>`), and inline-level elements (e.g. `<strong>`, `<em>`).

In 2014, HTML5 introduced many new structural elements, including the `<header`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` elements.

Semantic HTML
--------------

People often confuse language *semantics* with language *syntax*. Syntax is simply the grammar, or the rules for what parts of a language you can use and in what order. Every language — foreign or programming — has its own unique syntax. Semantics refers to the meaning of particular sentence or line of code. A sentence can follow proper syntax but contain no real meaning (e.g. "The water is triangular."). With programming, *pseudo code* emphasizes semantics over correct syntax, *error-free code* requires correct syntax over semantics, but *good code* requires both correct syntax and semantics.

Semantic HTML is the practice of giving content meaning and structure by  using the appropriate elements. Semantic HTML describes the content of a page rather than how the content should look on the page. Although writing semantic markup takes some extra effort, there are several benefits including improving accessibility by enabling screen readers and search engines to easily read and understand the content of a web page and making it easier for future developers to understand and update a web page.

Except for the `<div>` block and `<span>` inline element, all other HTML elements convey some semantic meaning.

CSS
----

CSS **selectors** designate which HTML elements to apply a specific CSS rule to. Selectors generally target an attribute value, such as an *id* or *class* value, or target the type of element, such as `<h1>` or `<p>`. Once an element is selected, CSS **properties** determine the styles that will be applied to that element. Each property must be given a corresponding property **value**.

![CSS syntax outline for a selector, properties, and values](http://learn.shayhowe.com/assets/images/courses/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/css-syntax-outline.png)

*Type* selectors target elements by their element type. *Class* selectors target elements based on their *class* attribute value. *ID* selectors target one unique element based on its *id* attribute value.

### CSS Resets

Since every web browser has their own default CSS rules for different elements, CSS resets are used by taking every common HTML element and assigning a unified style for all browsers.

### The Cascade

CSS properties are applied in the order in which they appear in a stylesheet (i.e. top-down). In other words, all rules *cascade* from the top of the stylesheet to the bottom, allowing new styles to override the behavior of styles written above them in the stylesheet. This behavior occurs whether the styles are applied using separate CSS rules or duplicated within the same CSS rule.

There are, however, times where the cascade doesn't play so nicely. Those times occur when different types of selectors are used and the specificity of those selectors breaks the cascade.

### CSS Specificity

Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. A selector’s weight, along with its location in the cascade, determines how and which of its properties will be applied.

The type selector has the lowest weight with a point value of `0-0-1`. The class selector has a point value of `0-1-1`. And the ID selector has a point value of `1-0-0`. In other words, the specificity weight of a particular selector is calculated using three columns of values.

The higher the weight of a selector, the more superiority it is given when a rule conflict occurs.  

Box Model
----------

According to the **box model** concept, *every element on a page is a rectangular box* and may have width, height, padding, borders, and margins.

![The box model](http://learn.shayhowe.com/assets/images/courses/html-css/opening-the-box-model/box-model.png)

### Width & Height

An element's default width depends on its `display` value. Block elements have a default width of 100%, while inline and inline-block elements expand and contract horizontally to accommodate its content.

An element's default height is determined by its content. An element will expand and contract vertically to accommodate its content.
The width and height of a non-inline element can be set using the `width` and `height` CSS properties.

### Margin & Padding

The `margin` property falls outside an element's border and determines the amount of space that separates an element from any surrounding elements.

The `padding` property is similar except it falls inside an element's border.

Both margins and paddings are completely transparent in color but behave slightly differently. For margins, the background color of the parent element is seen, and for padding, the background color of the current element is seen.

### Box Sizing

According to the box model, while the `width` and `height` values determine the dimensions of an element's content, the width and height of the entire element is affected by the `margin`, `padding`, and `border` values.

`element width = margin-right + border-right + padding-right + width + padding-left + border-left + margin-left`

`element height = margin-top + border-top + padding-top + height + padding-bottom + border-bottom + margin-bottom`

The behavior of the box model may be changed to support different calculations using the `box-sizing` property. The default value is `content-box` but this is commonly changed to `content-box` resulting in a much simpler formula to calculate an element's width and height.

`element width = margin-right + width + margin-left`

`element height = margin-top + height + margin-bottom`

CSS Property: `display`
---------------------

Exactly how elements are displayed is determined by the CSS `display` property. Every element has a default `display` property value; however, as with all other property values, it may be overwritten. The most common values are `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`.

Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. Inline-level elements line up one after the other on the same line and only maintain the width of their content. Block-level elements may  wrap inline-level elements but inline-level elements cannot wrap block-level elements.

### `display: block`

Block elements will always use the box model properties (`width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`) to determine how much space the content will take up and how much space the element will have between it and surrounding elements.

### `display: inline`

Any `width` and `height` properties applied to an inline element are ignored. The content dictates the dimensions.In addition, `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` properties are ignored.

As defined by the box model, the `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` properties create space between an inline element's content and its border. But these properties will not push away another element's content. Therefore, you run the risk of an inline element's border overlapping the content of an element above or below it. In order to push away content, the `line-height` property should be used instead.

The `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `padding-left`, and `padding-right` properties all work the same as for block-level elements.

### `display: inline-block`


Similar to inline elements, inline-block elements line up on the same line and their content dictates their dimensions. The difference is their dimensions can be changed using box model properties such as `width` and `height.`

The `inline-block` property value is usually applied when you either want to apply `width` or `height` to an inline element or you want to place block elements on the same line.

When using `inline-block`, a thing to remember is that a single space is included between inline-block elements. In order to simplify your box model calculations, the white space should be removed using comments.

  --><section>

Lengths
-------

There are a few different ways to indicate lengths in CSS. The first distinction is between *absolute* and *relative* lengths. The most absolute unit of measurement is the **pixel**, which is equal to 1/96th of an inch.

**Percentages (%)** are one of the most popular relative units of measurement and are assigned relative to an element's parent. For example, if an element is assigned `width: 50%`, the actual width applied is half that of its parent's width.

The **em** is a unit of typography equal to the currently specified font-size. So, for example, if an element has `font-size: 14px;` and `width: 5em`, the actual width applied would be 70 pixels (14 * 5). If the `font-size` is not explicitly stated, the em unit will be relative to the `font-size` of the closest parent with a stated `font-size`.

The **rem** is a unit of typography closely related to em. The difference is that rem is equal to the root `font-size`. Since most browsers set their default size at 16px, this is most often equal to 1rem.

Positioning with Floats
------------------------

The purpose of the `float` property is to shift a block element to the left or right edge of its parent, taking it out of the flow in relation to surrounding block elements. This allows naturally-flowing content like text to *wrap* around the floated element.

A floated element no longer occupies all available width and instead behaves similar to an inline-block element in that its content dictates its dimensions but these dimensions can be changed using box model properties such as `height` and `width`. Generally, a floated element should have an explicitly set width.

### Wrapping Elements

Since a floated element is removed from the normal flow, any surrounding non-floated block elements will position themselves as if the floated element isn't there. However, any line boxes (e.g. text) existing in these surrounding elements will shorten themselves within the their block element to make room for the floated element. If there is room, the line box will appear alongside the floated element and may continue beneath the floated element if there is enough content, resulting in the wrapping behavior.

### Layout using Floats

When multiple elements are floated, they will horizontally stack, providing the ability to create a layout. For example, when `float: left;` is applied to multiple elements, each floated element will shift to the left until its leftmost edge touches either the edge of its parent element, or the edge of another floated element. If the width of the floated element exceeds the available width, the element is shifted down.

### Containing Floats

An issue with using floats is that an element that contains floated elements does not take those floated elements into account when calculating its height. This occurs because the floated element(s) are taken out of the normal flow of the page and the parent container acts as if the floated element isn't even there.

There are many solutions to this problem but one of the currently accepted best practices is to use the `:after` pseudo-element.

  .clearfix:after {
    clear: both;
    content: "";
    display: block;
  }

  Another common solution is to use the `overflow` property.

  .clearfix {
    overflow: auto;
  }

Images
-------

The three types of images used most often are jpg, png, and gif. **JPG** is the most common format for image content, offering a good balance of quality and file size (i.e. compression). **PNG** is the most common format for background images, offering a lossless (i.e. no compression) image. PNG files are used for images requiring a high level of detail, alpha transparency, or more than 256 colors. **GIF** is a popular image format for animated images and small icons. Of these 3 formats, only GIF supports animation.

You can add an image to a web page using the `<img>` inline element or by using the `background-image` CSS property to assign a background image to an element. The `<img>` element is preferred option when the image holds semantic value and its content is relevant to the content of the page. The `background-image` property is preferred when the image is part of the design or user interface of the page and not directly relevant to the content of the page.

With the `<img>` element, the `src` attribute *must* be included to specify the image path and the `alt` attribute *should* be used to describe the image to screen readers. Images may be sized using the `width` and `height` CSS properties. Specifying either will cause the other dimension to adjust to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. Specifying both will likely assign a new aspect ratio, distorting the image.

The `<figure>` block-level element is used to identify and wrap self-contained content (e.g. image + caption). Specifically for a caption, the `<figcaption>` element can be used.
