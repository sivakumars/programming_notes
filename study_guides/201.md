201 Study Guide
=================

Notes created while preparing for Assessment 209. This assessment is designed to test knowledge of course 201 and will focus on HTML and CSS.

Introduction
------------

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that describes the content of a web page. **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation and appearance of an HTML web page. HTML and CSS documents are simply plain-text documents saved with a corresponding `.html` or `.css` extension. HTML and CSS are designed to enable the separation of content from the appearance of the content. This separation improves accessibility, performance, ease of maintenance, and can reduce redundancy by allowing the same CSS stylesheets to be applied to multiple HTML web pages. Any visible content should be included in the `<body>` element.

HTML
-----

To inform a web browser that you are using the latest version of HTML, `<!DOCTYPE html>` should be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document. Inside an `<html>` element, a `<head>` element should contain information about the document (e.g. document character set, document title, links to external stylesheets or files). Any content inside the `<head>` is not displayed on the web page itself.

<pre><code><!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html></code></pre>

HTML **elements** are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a web page. Most elements are marked by a pair of opening and closing **tags**, and the content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. **Attributes** are properties defined within the opening tag and provide additional information about an element. Each attribute contains a *name* and a *value*.

Images
-------

The three types of images used most often are jpg, png, and gif. **JPG** is the most common format for image content, offering a good balance of quality and file size (i.e. compression). **PNG** is the most common format for background images, offering a lossless (i.e. no compression) image. PNG files are used for images requiring a high level of detail, alpha transparency, or more than 256 colors. **GIF** is a popular image format for animated images and small icons. Of these 3 formats, only GIF supports animation.

You can add an image to a web page using the `<img>` inline element or by using the `background-image` CSS property to assign a background image to an element. The `<img>` element is preferred option when the image holds semantic value and its content is relevant to the content of the page. The `background-image` property is preferred when the image is part of the design or user interface of the page and not directly relevant to the content of the page.

With the `<img>` element, the `src` attribute *must* be included to specify the image path and the `alt` attribute *should* be used to describe the image to screen readers. Images may be sized using the `width` and `height` CSS properties. Specifying either will cause the other dimension to adjust to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. Specifying both will likely assign a new aspect ratio, distorting the image.

The `<figure>` block-level element is used to identify and wrap self-contained content (e.g. image + caption). Specifically for a caption, the `<figcaption>` element can be used.
