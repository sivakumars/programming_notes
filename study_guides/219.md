219 Study Guide
=================

Notes created while preparing for Assessment 219. This assessment is designed to test knowledge of course 210 and will focus on Computational Thinking and Javascript Programming.

Introduction
------------

**Javascript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created in 1994 by Brendan Eich. The purpose of the language was to provide a way for web sites to be dynamic and more interactive.

Primitive Data Types
-----------

Javascript is a *loosely typed* or *dynamic* language, meaning you don't have to declare the type of variable ahead of time.

A **primitive** is a data type that is not an object and has no methods.  Javascript (ES5) contains five primitive data types: `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `null`, and `undefined`. All primitives are *immutable* (cannot be changed in memory).

In addition, JS contains one compound data type: `object`. Under the umbrella of objects are additional sub-types: `function`, `array`, and `regexp`.

Except for `null` and `undefined`, all primitives have object equivalents that wrap around their primitive values. This allows you to access properties and call methods on them.

### Number

Unlike most other languages, Javascript uses a floating point system to represent the `number` type. A common issue that arises from this implementation is that there seem to be rounding errors when computing with numbers.

`0.1 + 0.1; // returns 0.30000000000000004, not 0.3!`

It's best to avoid fractional numbers and instead use an integer number of the smallest relative units. For example, if you're working with money, represent the amount in an integer value of cents rather than a decimal value of dollars. And if you're working with time, use seconds instead of hours.

The special number value of `NaN` indicates an illegal operation on numbers. Comparing `NaN` with any value (including itself) evaluates to `false`.

```javascript
Number('abc'); // NaN
Math.sqrt(-1); // NaN
undefined + 1; // NaN

typeof(NaN);   // "number"
NaN === NaN;   // false
```

Variable Scopes and Hoisting
----------------------------

A variable's scope is defined by where the variable was declared and determines where in a program the variable is available for use.
