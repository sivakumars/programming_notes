109 Study Guide
=================

Notes created to help prepare for Assessment 109. This assessment is designed to test knowledge of courses 100 and 101, which broadly covers the Ruby programming language, stopping short of Object Oriented Programming.

Local Variable Scope
--------------------
A variable's scope is defined by where the variable was initialized and determines where in a program the variable is available for use. A block, a piece of code following a method invocation, creates new scope. Examples: `loop`, `while`, `until`, `times`, `each`, `map`, `collect`, `select`, `detect`.

A variable initialized in an outer scope **can** be accessed in an inner scope.

```ruby
last_name = "savant"

loop do
  full_name = "nitin " + last_name # accesses variable from outer scope
  break
end
```

But a variable initialized inside a block **cannot** be accessed outside that block.

```ruby
loop do
  first_name = "nitin"
  break
end

full_name = first_name + " savant" # => Name Error: undefined local variable `first_name'
```

Ruby's control expressions **do not** create new scope. Examples: `if/elsif/else`, `case/when`, `unless`, `while`, `until`, `for`.

```ruby
for i in (1...2) do
  first_name = "nitin" # initializes variable that is accessible outside loop
end

puts first_name # => 'nitin'
```

If a variable is reassigned by inner scoped, the reassignment will be reflected in the outer scope, where that variable was initialized.

```ruby
last_name = "halgekar"

loop do
  last_name = "savant" # re-assigns outer scope variable
  break
end

puts last_name # => 'savant'
```

Methods create their own scope that's entirely outside of the execution flow.

```ruby
last_name = "halgekar"

def name
  last_name = "savant" # initializes separate last_name variable in own scope
end

puts last_name # => 'halgekar'
```

Methods **cannot** directly access variables initialized outside the method (i.e. from a different scope).

```ruby
first_name = "nitin"

def name
  full_name = first_name + " savant" # => NameError: undefined local variable `first_name'
end
```

Methods **can** access objects passed as arguments.

```ruby
first_name = "nitin"

def rename(first_name)
  full_name = first_name + " savant"
end

puts rename(first_name) # => "nitin savant"
```

Variables as Pointers
---------------------

A variable is a pointer to a space in memory, acting as a label for the space. When a variable is **reassigned**, it's pointed to a different memory space and **does not** affect any other variables that were pointed to its original memory space.

```ruby
string = "hello"
another_string = string
string = "goodbye" # reassigns/points string to a new space in memory
puts another_string # => "hello"
```

When a destructive action is performed on a variable, the variable continues to point to the same memory space but the destructive action changes the value of the space, thereby affecting any variables pointing to that space. This is called *mutating the caller*.

```ruby
string = "hello"
another_string = string
string << " goodbye" # changes actual value in the memory space where string & another_string are pointed
puts another_string # => "hello goodbye"
```

When a variable is passed as an argument, the method initializes a new variable that points to the same memory space as the argument. If that new variable is reassigned within the method, it's pointed to a different memory space and does not affect the value of the argument. But if a destructive action is performed on that new variable, the value of the argument (and any other variables pointing to that memory space) are affected.

```ruby
num = [1]

def append_by_reassignment(input)
  input += [1] # reassignment points input to a new space in memory
end

def append_by_concatenation(input)
  input << 1 # destructive action changes the value in memory — *mutates the caller*
end

append_by_reassignment(num)  # => [1, 1]
num                          # => [1]
append_by_concatenation(num) # => [1, 1]
num                          # => [1, 1]
```

Pass by Reference vs. Pass by Value
-----------------------------------

Since re-assigning an object within a method **does not** affect the object's value outside the method, Ruby is considered by some to be  *pass by value*.

```ruby
name = "nitin"

def rename(name)
  name = "niteen"
end

rename(name)
puts name # => "nitin"
```

Since certain methods **do** affect an object's value outside the method, Ruby isn't really pure *pass by value*. With these *destructive* methods, Ruby behaves as a *pass by reference* language.

```ruby
name = "nitin"

def rename(name)
  name.upcase!
end

rename(name)
puts name # => "NITIN"
```

 Whether Ruby acts as *pass by value* or *pass by reference* depends on the operation. Some call this **pass by reference of the value**.

 Common String Methods
 -----------------------

 A string is a list of characters in a specific sequence.

```ruby
"hello" * 3 # => "hellohellohello"

"hello" + "world" # => "helloworld"

"hello" << "world" # => "helloworld"

"world".prepend("hello") # => "helloworld"

"helloworld"[4] # => "o"

"helloworld"[4,5] # => "oworl"

"helloworld"[4..6] # => "owo"

"helloworld"["ll"] # => "ll"

"hello".include?("ll") => true

"helloworld" =~ /o/ # => 4

"helloworld" =~ /c/ # => nilÂ

"hello".gsub("llo", "ckle") => "heckle"

"hello".gsub(/[aeiou]/, "a") => "halla"

"hello".delete("l") # => "heo"

"hello".chars # => ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

"hello".split("") # => ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

"hello".reverse # => "olleh"

"stars".center(15) # => "     stars     "

"stars".center(15, '*') # => "*****stars*****"

"stars".rjust(15, '*') # => "**********stars"

"hellow".chop # => "hello"

"whaaaat".chr # => "w"
```

Common Array Methods
--------------------

An array is an ordered list of elements that can be of any type.

```ruby
array = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
array[1..3] # => ["e", "l", "l""]
array[1...3] # => ["e", "l"]
array[2, 2] # => ["l", "l"]
array.count # => 5
array.count("l") # => 2
array.join # => "hello"

[1, 2, 3] & [2, 3, 4] # => [2, 3]

[1, 2, 3] | [2, 3, 4] # => [1, 2, 3, 4]

[1, 2, 3] + [2, 3, 4] # => [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]

[1, 2, 3] << 2 << 3 << 4 # => [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]

[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] - [1, 2, 4] # => [3, 3, 5]]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].find_index(3) # => 2

[1, 2, 3].include?(2) # => true

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.first # => 1
array # => [1, 2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.take(1) # => [1]
array # => [1, 2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.drop(2) # => [3]
array # => [1, 2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.last # => 3
array # => [1, 2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.pop # => 3
array # => [1, 2]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.push(3) # => 3
array # => [1, 2, 3, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.shift # => 1
array # => [2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3]
array.unshift(1) # => [1, 1, 2, 3]
array # => [1, 1, 2, 3]

array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]
array.delete(3) # => 3
array # => [1, 2, 5]

array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]
array.delete_at(3) # => 3
array # => [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

Common Hash Methods
--------------------

A hash stores elements by associated keys, resulting in a list of key-value pairs.

```ruby
hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
hash.keys # => [:name, :age, :employed?]
hash.values # => ["nitin", 30, false]
hash[:name] # => "nitin"
hash[:hometown]# => nil
hash.fetch(:name) # => "nitin"
hash.fetch(:hometown) #=> KeyError: key not found: :hometown
hash.key("nitin") # => :name
hash.has_value?("nitin") # => true
hash.has_key?(:employed?) # => true
hash.size # => 3
hash.to_a # => [[:name, "nitin"], [:age, 30], [:employed?, false]]

hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
hash.delete(:age) # => 30
hash # => {:name=>"nitin", :employed?=>false}
hash[:age] = 31 # => 31
hash # => {:name=>"nitin", :employed?=>false, :age=>31}

hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
hash.shift # => [:name, "nitin"]

hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
```

Collection Methods
-------------------

Collections are a way to store lists of data. String, Hash, Array, Range, Set, and Enumerator are all collection objects. There are many methods that allow you to iterate (i.e. execute the given block once for each element in the collection) through collections. This is possible due to the Enumerable module that is *mixed in* to the various collection classes. Enumerator is an object that is returned by an Enumerable method if no block is passed to it; the existence of the Enumerator object is what allows method chaining.

`each` executes a given block once for each element and returns the collection.

```ruby
string = "launchschool"
string.each_char {|char| puts char } # outputs each character on separate lines and returns string

string = "launchschool"
string.chars.each {|char| puts char } # outputs each character on separate lines and returns an array of the characters

string = "launch school"
string.split.each { |word| puts word } # outputs each word on separate lines and returns an array of the words

[1, 2, 3].each { |element| puts element } # outputs each element on separate lines and returns array

hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
hash.each { |key, value| puts "#{key} #{value}" } # outputs each key/value pair on separate lines and returns hash
```

`select` evaluates a block once for each element and returns a new collection that includes only elements whose block evaluation returns `true`. `reject` is the opposite of select.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].select {|element| element > 1 } # => [2, 3]
[1, 2, 3].reject {|element| element > 1 } # => [1]

hash = { name: "nitin", age: 30, employed?: false }
hash.select { |key, value| value } # => {:name=>"nitin", :age=>30}
hash.reject { |key, value| value } # => {:employed?=>false}
```

`map` executes a block once for each element and returns a new collection with the results of each block's execution. The `collect` method is an alias to `map` — they do the same thing.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].map { |element| element*2 } # => [2, 4, 6]

hash = { nitin: 30, bob: 35, carlos: 40 }
hash.map { |key, value| value + 5 } # => [35, 40, 45]
```

`reduce` iterates through each element and passes the result of each iteration as an argument in the next iteration. Unless specified, the default value of `result = 0` for the first iteration. After the final iteration, the final value of `result` is returned. `inject` is an alias to `reduce` — they do the same thing.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce { |result, element| result + element } # => 15
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce(:+) # => 15
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce(5, :+) # => 20
```

There are various other methods available to collections.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].detect { |number| number > 2 } # => 3

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sort { |num1, num2| num2 <=> num1 } # => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

["nitin", "bob", "carlos"].sort_by { |word| word.length } # => ["bob", "nitin", "carlos"]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].any? { |num| num > 5 } # => false

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].all? { |num| num > 0 } # => true

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].none? { |num| num > 5 } # => true

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].one? { |num| num > 4 } # => true

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].max # => 5

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].min # => 1

[1, 2, 3].zip([4, 5, 6]) #=> [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]

```

Puts vs. Return
---------------

Almost everything written in Ruby is an expression, and Ruby expressions always return a value.

```ruby
num = 2 # => 2
num + 1 # => 3
```

Expressions have two effects: they **do** something and they **return** something. But the value returned is not necessarily the action that was performed.

```ruby
name = "nitin" # => assigns name to "nitin" AND returns "nitin"
puts name # => prints "nitin" AND returns nil
```

In addition to `puts`, the value of expressions can be printed using `print` and `p`. They all return `nil`.

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

puts array # converts each element to a string, prints each element, adds newline after each, and returns nil
1
2
3
=> nil

p array # prints array.inspect, adds newline, and returns nil
[1, 2, 3]
=> nil

print array # converts entire array to string, prints, and returns nil
[1, 2, 3]=> nil
```

Implicit Return of Blocks & Methods
------------------------------------

Methods always implicitly return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it. At this point, execution of the method is stopped and any code after the `return` is ignored.

```ruby
def last_line
  "first line"
  "second line"
  "third line"
end

puts last_line # => "third line"

def returned_line
  "first line"
  return "second line"
  "third line"
end

puts returned_line # => "second line"
```
