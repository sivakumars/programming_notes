149 Study Guide
=================

Notes created while preparing for Assessment 149. This assessment is designed to test knowledge of courses 120 and 130 and will mainly focus on Object Oriented Programming concepts, though all prior material is fair game as well.

Classes and Objects
--------------------

Historically, a program has been viewed as a procedure that takes input data, processes it with step-by-step instructions, and provides output data. This is referred to as procedural programming.

**Object Oriented Programming** is a paradigm that was created to deal with the growing complexity of large programs. Programmers needed a way to change a piece of a large program without unexpectedly affecting the entire program.

OOP addresses this concern by using containers to group related attributes (or data) and behavior (or instructions). The container is called an object and the class is the outline of the possible attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods) of that object.

In Ruby, everything is an object. Strings, Arrays, Hashes, and Integers are all types of objects. And the properties and methods available to each of these object types is outlined in their class.

The workflow of creating a new object is called **instantiation.** In the example below, an instance of the Dog class was created and stored in the variable `my_dog`.

```ruby
class Dog
end

my_dog = Dog.new
```

Let's modify the class by adding an `initialize` method. If defined, the `initialize` method is called every time you create a new object. This type of method is known as a constructor.

```ruby
class Dog
  def initialize
    puts "You created a new Dog!"
  end
end

my_dog = Dog.new # => "You created a new Dog!"
```

Instance Methods and Instance Variables
---------------------------------------

Let's add behavior to a class. The Dog class now has a `bark` method that can be called on any Dog object. We define these behaviors as instance methods in a class.

```ruby
class Dog
  def bark
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

my_dog = Dog.new
my_dog.bark # => outputs "Woof!"
```

Let's add an attribute to a class. The Dog class now has a `name` attribute. In addition, there are a couple new instance methods that allow an object to assign (`set_name`) and retrieve (`get_name`) the name of a Dog object. In addition to `name`, we can allow the object to track other information about a Dog object, like age or weight. We use instance variables to track this information.

```ruby
class Dog
  def set_name(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def get_name
    @name
  end

  def bark
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

my_dog = Dog.new
my_dog.set_name("Fitz")
my_dog.get_name # => returns "Fitz"
```

Getter/Setter methods
